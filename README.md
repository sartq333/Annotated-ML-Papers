# Annotated-ML-Papers

Annotations of the interesting ML/DL papers I read.
Inspired by [this](https://github.com/shreyansh26/Annotated-ML-Papers) and [this](https://github.com/AakashKumarNain/annotated_research_papers).

These 2 sites can come in handy while finding research papers to read:

[papers with code](https://paperswithcode.com/)

[hugging face papers](https://huggingface.co/papers)
